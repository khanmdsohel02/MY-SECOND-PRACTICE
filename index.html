                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>Bangladesh has made impressive gains in key human development indicators in recent years. According to the 2018 UNDP Human Development Index Statistical Update, Bangladesh ranks 136th among 189 countries with an HDI score of 0.608, placing it among countries considered to have achieved medium human development. 8 million people have moved out of poverty since 2010. The country is also on track to reach the first Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.</p><br>

               <p>But even as Bangladesh has taken these considerable steps towards poverty alleviation, many challenges remain. As of 2016, almost a quarter of the population (24.3%) still live in poverty. The constant threat of shocks – natural, political, or economic - the uncertain impact of globalization, and an increasingly competitive international trade environment impede higher growth rates. In addition, structural changes in rural Bangladesh have spurred rapid economic migration. This exacerbates urban poverty, creates a lack of reliable work and leads to congestion and limited shelter in urban areas. The rate of reduction in urban poverty has decreased in the last few years, only decreasing by 2.4 percentage points (from 21.3% to 18.9%). Bangladesh thus faces considerable challenges to sustain and build on the achievements of the last decade, and to remain on track to meet its targets under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p><br>
